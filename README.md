In this study we introduce a real-time face
recognition system for attendance management which integrates
classical machine learning techniques with a very simple
desktop interface for making the use of it easier. The system
integrates global and local feature extraction methods, namely
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Local Binary Patterns
(LBP), to produce robust face representations. A Linear SVM
classifier is used to make identification faster and accurate,
while the proposed design is a dimensionality reduction
approach that employs SelectKBest along with hyperparameter
tuning through GridSearchCV to guarantee maximum
performance. The system has a graphical user interface (GUI)
built using Tkinter, so that real-time attendance checks may be
made by interfacing the application with a camera. The
experimental results show high training and testing accuracies
while maintaining computationally efficient algorithms required
for real-time applications.
